class City(BaseModel, Base):
    '''
        Defines the class City that inherits from BaseModel and Base, the
        declarative base from SQLAlchemy.

        City objects will be mapped to a MySQL table called 'cities'

        Since City objects inherit from BaseModel, they will have access to the
        following Columns:
            `BaseModel.id`
            `BaseModel.created_at`
            `BaseModel.updated_at`

        There is a relationship() between City and State. The relationship is
        defined in the State class. The `backref='state'` parameter establishes
        a `state` attribute in this class. So each City will have a `state`
        parameter. For example, if California has a state_id of 1, and you make
        a City with a state_id of 1, you can access the name of your City's
        state using `City.state.name`.
